Speedup and Effiency (Table + 2 graphs) ->
1. By fixing number of threads
2. Fixing the problem size, vary the number of threads


Strong vs Weak Scaling


# To Do
- [ ] Find out Number of threads running
  - [ ] Terminal Command to compile and run (To set threads)
- [ ] Why is efficiency low? Calculate processing vs communicating time
