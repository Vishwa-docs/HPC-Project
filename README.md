# HPC Project

# To Do
1. We both will research which optimization algorithm we can use for batch filtering parallelizatiob and decide by Thursday.

2. We’ll also start coding the basic part such as loading the image dataset and applying a filter with OpenCL. Both will try this and keep updating the notion page.

3. Then we’ll try figuring out how to code the optimization part with the parallelisation thing in C and integrate it.
